# Least Time to the Rescue
A paper and Python simulation applying the law of refraction and principle of least time to find the most time-efficient position for a lifeguard to jump into the water to save a drowning person using realistic values.

## Dependencies
Every Python file uses `sympy`
`simulation.py` uses `pygame`
`heatmap.py` uses `seaborn`

## Use
The Python files in this repository are the files used to generate the graphs used in the paper and are not of much use on their own. `simulation.py` is a simulation that visualises the lifeguard's path to the target with user-specified conditions. Click anywhere in the water region to set the target location and use `w` and `s` to move the lifeguard farther or closer to the waterfront, respectively.
